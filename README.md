# XSS Detection Using CNN (Deep Learning)

This project demonstrates how to detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in HTML using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It converts HTML content into ASCII matrices and feeds them to a CNN for binary classification (malicious vs. benign).

## 🔍 Features
- Converts HTML code into normalized ASCII matrices (image-like format)
- Classifies input as XSS or benign using a trained CNN model
- Preprocessing pipeline with BeautifulSoup and OpenCV
- Model trained on labeled dataset from Kaggle

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **HTML Preprocessing**:
   - HTML is cleaned using `BeautifulSoup`
   - Each character is converted to an ASCII value
   - The ASCII array is padded and reshaped to a `100x100` matrix
   - Matrix is normalized to values between 0 and 1

2. **CNN Architecture**:
   - 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU + MaxPooling
   - Dense layers for decision-making
   - Sigmoid output for binary classification

3. **Prediction**:
   - Model outputs a probability between 0 and 1
   - Threshold > 0.5 → XSS detected

## 🔍 Example Predictions

| HTML Snippet                                      | Prediction       | Confidence |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|
| `<a href="http://example.com">Click</a>`         | ✅ Safe           | 0.04       |
| `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`                  | ❌ XSS Detected   | 0.98       |
| `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`           | ❌ XSS Detected   | 0.92       |
| `<div onclick="console.log('safe')">Click</div>` | ✅ Safe           | 0.12       |
